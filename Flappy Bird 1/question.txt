i have a pretty weird behaviour

i expect to just collide with the AnimatebleBody not be dragged by it

the CharacterBody2D Velocity is only up-down so the X is always 0

the AnimatableBody2D moves to the left
but when i try to move_and_collide the AnimatebleBody its weird and 100% doesnt work

```
_PhysicsProcess_Pipe(double delta)
  var motion = new Vector2(-speed * (float)delta, 0);
  //var coll = MoveAndCollide(motion);
  Position += motion;

_PhysicsProcess_Player(double delta)
  var coll = MoveAndCollide(Velocity * (float)delta);
  /*if (Node.IsInstanceValid(coll)) //we collided
  {
    Die();
  }*/

  if (Node.IsInstanceValid(coll) || TestMove(Transform,new Vector2(1,0))) //we collided or have a pipe next to us
  {
    Die();
  }
```

i kinda dont wanna check for a pipe to my right cause it feels janky to do that
